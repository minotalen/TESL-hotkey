### TESL hotkeys

The included .ahk file is an autohotkey script for TESL which enables you to control parts of the game with your keyboard. The script itself is currently very rudimentary, it has only been tested with my screen resolution.

I have mapped the y key so it copies the x and y coordinates of the mouse position. These coordinates can be used to edit the script for your resolution.

#### next changes

* variables for all coordinates to allow configuration to different resolutions

* a way to select cards in hand (moving through them with A and D for example)

* a way to select creatures on board (both own and enemy creatures)

* buttons to view own/opp deck and discard
